  # without confirming the account, but blocking it after a certain period 
  # (ie 2 days).

  # time the user will be asked for credentials again.

  # ==> Configuration for :lockable
  # Defines which strategy will be used to lock an account.
  # :failed_attempts = Locks an account after a number of failed attempts to sign in.
  # :none            = No lock strategy. You should handle locking by yourself.
  # config.lock_strategy = :failed_attempts

  # Defines which strategy will be used to unlock an account.

  # ==> Scopes configuration

  # "users/sessions/new". It's turned off by default because it's slower if you
  # are using only default views.

  # In case of sign_out_all_scopes set to true any logout action will sign out all active scopes.
  # config.sign_out_all_scopes = false

  # ==> Navigation configuration
  # Lists the formats that should be treated as navigational. Formats like
  # :html, should redirect to the sign in page when the user does not have
  # access, but formats like :xml or :json, should return 401.
  # If you have any extra navigational formats, like :iphone or :mobile, you
  # should add them to the navigational formats lists. Default is [:html]
  # config.navigational_formats = [:html, :iphone]

  # ==> Warden configuration
  # If you want to use other strategies, that are not (yet) supported by Devise,
  # you can configure them inside the config.warden block. The example below
  # allows you to setup OAuth, using http://github.com/roman/warden_oauth
  #
  # config.warden do |manager|
  #   manager.oauth(:twitter) do |twitter|
  #     twitter.consumer_secret = <YOUR CONSUMER SECRET>
  #     twitter.consumer_key  = <YOUR CONSUMER KEY>
  #     twitter.options :site => 'http://twitter.com'
  #   end
  #   manager.default_strategies(:scope => :user).unshift :twitter_oauth
